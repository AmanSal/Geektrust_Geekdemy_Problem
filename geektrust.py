# PROBLEM STATEMENT

# Context

#  CERTIFICATION - Rs.3000 
#  DEGREE - Rs. 5000 
#  DIPLOMA - Rs 2500 
# Coupons
#  The discount coupons offered by Geekdemy are based on different criteria. Only one discount coupon can be applied at a time.
 
#  B4G1 - This coupon is applied automatically if 4 or more programmes are being purchased. The student gets one programme for free. The lowest priced programme is given for FREE.
 
#  DEAL_G20 - This coupon can be applied if the purchased programmes value is Rs.10,000/- or above. It provides a 20% discount on the total programme cost. The coupon needs to be applied explicitly to get a discount.
 
#  DEAL_G5 - This coupon can only be applied if there are a minimum of 2 programmes being purchased. It provides a 5% discount on the total programme cost. The coupon needs to be applied explicitly to get a discount.
 
# Enrollment Fee
#  If the total programme cost is below Rs. 6666/, an extra enrollment fee Rs.500/- is added to the cart. The enrollment fee is applied after the discount. If the total programme cost is or above Rs.6666/- the enrollment fee is waived off.
 
# Pro Membership Fee
#  A student can choose to purchase a Pro Membership for a small amount of Rs.200/- . The pro membership provides an additional membership discount on each of the individual programmes on top of the other discounts.
 
#  DIPLOMA - 1% discount 
#  CERTIFICATION - 2% discount 
#  DEGREE - 3% discount
 
# Assumptions
#  A student can add any number of programmes to the cart. 
#  A student can add the same category of programme multiple times. 
#  A student can choose to buy pro membership or not.  
#  If a student has  purchased a pro membership and has applied for a coupon, The coupon discount is applied after applying the pro membership discounts. 
#  The B4G1 coupon gets auto applied when there are more than 4 programmes in the cart. 
#  All the other coupons (DEAL_G20, DEAL_G5) need to be applied on the cart, if not no discount is provided. 
#  If there are 4 or more programmes in the cart and the student has applied for a coupon other than B4G1, B4G1 coupon will be used, and the other coupon needs to be ignored. 
#  If 2 or more coupons are applied, the higher value coupon needs to be considered (except in the case of 4 or more programmes; in that case B4G1 is auto applied).
# 	eg: if a student applies the coupon DEAL_G20 and DEAL_G5 and the purchase value is greater than 10,000, then DEAL_G20 needs to be considered.
# 	eg: if a student applies the coupon DEAL_G20 and DEAL_G5 and the purchase value is greater than 10,000, then DEAL_G20 needs to be considered.
